**ABSTRACT**

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has enjoyed great success in decision-making domains such as
robotics, games, or autonomous driving. Simultaneously, housing prices have continued to rise, contributing
to social inequality. This thesis seeks to study the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods for
designing collaborative housing aggregations. It examines whether intelligent agents can cooperate and learn
behaviours that create complex systems.
The research explores the training and evaluation phases, using game engines to compute interactive
environments. Distilling housing problems into sets of simple rules, it prioritises urban parameters such as
height, sun-light, protected green areas or floor-to-area ratio (FAR). Computationally, the training phase
comprises several configurations, based on the novel MultiAgent POsthumous Credit Assignment (MA-POCA)
that uses decentralised agents and a central critic. The resulting behaviours are evaluated using the same
conditions and comparing to understanding the rules that yield more efficient housing aggregations. After
training, key concerns are maximising occupancy ratios, FAR and time to compute aggregations.
Tools that enable decentralised mass housing facilitate access to high-quality, affordable homes for those
excluded from homeownership. This study suggests an innovative use of MARL systems for collaborative
housing where agents continuously interact to meet their briefs. The proposed computation allows for the
implementation of additional rules and can be applied to other architectural problems.
